# Quantitative Momentum Strategy
`Momentum investing` means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

Real-world quantitative investment firms differentiate between `high quality` and `low quality` momentum stocks:

* High-quality momentum stocks show `slow and steady` outperformance over long periods of time
* Low-quality momentum stocks might not show any momentum for a long time, and then surge upwards.

The reason why high-quality momentum stocks are preferred is because low-quality momentum can often be cause by short-term news that is unlikely to be repeated in the future (such as an FDA approval for a biotechnology company).

To identify high-quality momentum, we're going to build a strategy that selects stocks from the highest percentiles of: 

* 1-month price returns
* 3-month price returns
* 6-month price returns
* 1-year price returns

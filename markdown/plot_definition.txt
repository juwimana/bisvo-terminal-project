1. #### [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-bollinger-bands-to-gauge-trends/)
`Created by John Bollinger in the 1980s`, the bands offer unique insights into `price and volatility`. `Bollinger Bands identify asset prices that have deviated from the mean`. Bollinger Bands are a trading tool used to `determine entry and exit points for a trade`. The bands are often used to determine `overbought and oversold conditions`. `Using only the bands to trade is a risky strategy` since the indicator focuses on price and volatility, while ignoring a lot of other relevant information. Bollinger Bands are `composed of three lines`. One of the more common calculations uses a `20-day simple moving average (SMA)` for the middle band. The `upper band` is calculated by taking the middle band and adding twice the daily standard deviation to that amount. The `lower band` is calculated by taking the middle band minus two times the daily standard deviation. A common approach when using Bollinger Bands is to `identify overbought or oversold market conditions`. When the price of the asset breaks `below the lower band` of the Bollinger Bands, prices have perhaps fallen too much and are due to bounce. On the other hand, when price breaks `above the upper band`, the market is perhaps overbought and due for a pullback. Bollinger Bands `adapt dynamically` to price expanding and contracting as volatility increases and decreases. Therefore, the `bands naturally widen and narrow in sync with price action`, creating a very accurate trending envelope.

2. #### [Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)
`Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)` is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. MACD triggers technical signals when it `crosses above (to buy)` or `below (to sell)` its signal line.
The `speed of crossovers` is also taken as a signal of a market is overbought or oversold. MACD helps investors understand whether the bullish or bearish movement in the price is strengthening or weakening.
